3. __Protection of Confidential Information.__ Recipient acknowledges that Company claims that its Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset and agrees to the following:

(a) For a period of 5 years from first disclosure of or access to Confidential Information, Recipient: (i) will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party; and (ii)will use the Confidential Information only for the Purpose and will not use it for any third party's benefit. Recipient will use the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure as it would use to protect his/her own information of a similar nature, but in no event with less than reasonable care.

(b) Recipient's obligations under this Agreement with respect to particular information do not apply to the extent that: (i) Company authorizes Recipient in writing to disclose such information; (ii) Recipient knows such information at the time of disclosure by Company, free of any obligation to keep it confidential, as evidenced by written records; (iii) such information is or becomes generally known in the relevant industry without fault of Recipient; (iv) Recipient independently develops such information without access to or use of the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written records; or (v) Recipient rightfully obtains such information from a third party who has the right to disclose it without violation of any confidentiality obligations. However, even if certain information is already known, Company’s use of it (including the fact of Company's use and the manner and results of use) may not be and thus would be considered to be Confidential Information. Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such Confidential Information is embraced by more general knowledge in the public domain or in Recipient's possession. In addition, no combination of features shall be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are in the public domain or in Recipient's possession, unless the combination itself and its principles of operations are in the public domain or in Recipient's possession.

(c) If Recipient is subject to judicial or governmental proceedings requiring disclosure of Confidential Information, then, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient will provide Company with reasonable prior notice and will obtain, or provide Company with an opportunity to obtain, a protective order or confidential treatment of the Confidential Information.

7. No Inducement Or Commitment. Company will determine in its sole discretion the information to be disclosed to Recipient. Neither the disclosure nor access to Confidential Information under this Agreement constitutes an inducement or commitment to enter into any employment, consulting or other business relationship. If the parties desire to pursue employment, consulting or other business opportunities, the parties will execute separate written agreement(s).

This Agreement will not be modified, and no provision will be waived, except by a writing that both parties sign. A party's failure to require performance will not affect the party's right to require such performance at any later time.
